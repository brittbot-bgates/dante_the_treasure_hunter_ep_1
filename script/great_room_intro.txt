~ Dante walks into the Great Room, which is partially illuminated by the light coming through the uncurtained windows.
~ The Treasure Hunter sees the room is full of furniture, from sofas and recliners to wooden curio cabinets and various sizes of tables.
~ A thick layer of dust and cobwebs covers everything. Dante can see his footprints on the floor.
"Hmm...the curio cabinets could hold some loot, but those probably hold figurines."
He switches on his headlamp which is attached to his head via a headband. Dante takes a detailed look at the cabinets.
"Nope, these don't hold any treasure. Just junk figurines. Oh well, let's keep going."
