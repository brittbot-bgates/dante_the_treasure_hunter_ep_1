~ Dante runs out of the garage after defeating the Cursed Guard Captain and down the Main Hallway.
~ He stops when he comes across two bedrooms and a bathroom, leaning over to catch his breath.
"That...last...fight...was...tough."
~ The Treasure Hunter kneels down onto one knee to regain his strength faster.
"I think these rooms...are the final ones in the house. I'll hurry up and search them and get out of this cursed place."
