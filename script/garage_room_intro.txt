~ Dante enters the garage cautiously as the room is completely dark.
~ The light from his headlamps cuts the darkness with a wide beam but it can't illuminate the entire room.
"I don't have a good feeling about this."
The Treasure Hunter moves his head around to see what's in the room.
"So this is the garage but it's totally empty. I don't even remnants of a car or even a bicycle being stored here."
~ Dante turns to exit the room but after taking a few steps a figure materializes before him.
"What the chicken?!"
~ The owner of the cursed mansion, Ezekiel Johnson, stands before the Treasure Hunter.
"This is your final warning, Dante. Leave my home now and save your life. You have been lucky so far to defeat my guards. However, your luck will not last."
"I don't depends on luck, sir. I defeated your guards because I'm a skilled fighter. Now I'm not leaving until I finish searching this house."
"You will not take any more of my and my family's belongings. Guard Captain! Take care of him!"
The mansion owner dematerializes, only for the Guard Captain to appear in his space.
"Where my guards failed I will succeed."
"Oh, I like to see you try."
