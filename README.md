# Dante, The Treasure Hunter

## *Episode #1: The Famed Loot of The Maledictus Mansion*

This is a text-based dungeon-crawler game where you play as Dante, a world-famous treasure hunter who travels to exotic locations around the world to search dangerous buildings for its famed loot.

~~**NOTE:** This game is a work-in-progress and is currently not playable yet.~~

~~ **2/25/23 Update:** You can play through the first three rooms but I need to change the map again because it's going in a circle. ~~

**2/26/23 Update:** I revamped the game map so the first two rooms are playable.
