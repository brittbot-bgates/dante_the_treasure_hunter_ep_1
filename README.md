# Dante, The Treasure Hunter

## *Episode #1: The Famed Loot of The Maledictus Mansion*

This is a text-based dungeon-crawler game where you play as Dante, a world-famous treasure hunter who travels to exotic locations around the world to search dangerous buildings for its famed loot.

## Game Requirements

I suggest using the latest Python 3 version to run the game.

If you use Mac OS or Linux then Python is already installed on your computer. For Windows users you will probably have to download and install Python from [https://www.python.org/](Python.org).

## How To Run The Game

Download all the files and place them into a directory. Then run the main.py file to start the game.

## Updates

~~**NOTE:** This game is a work-in-progress and is currently not playable yet.~~

~~**2/25/23 Update:** You can play through the first three rooms but I need to change the map again because it's going in a circle.~~

**2/26/23 Update:** I revamped the game map so the first two rooms are playable.
